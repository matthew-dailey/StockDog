## StockDog

This application is the example application from the first chapter of the book [Professional AngularJS](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-AngularJS-Valeri-Karpov/dp/1118832078).

The author also has a [GitHub page](https://github.com/diegonetto/stock-dog) for the final product.

## Install

From nothing, download and install [node.js](https://nodejs.org).  This will include `npm`, the node package manager.

Then, install packages from npm (I had to do this as root to install globally)

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install -g bower
npm install -g generator-angular@0.9.8
```
